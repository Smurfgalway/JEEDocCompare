# JEEDocCompare

## Project Overview & Brief
This is a project for my ADVANCED OBJECT ORIENTED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT module in college. For this module we were given a project to create a dynamic web application using eclipse JEE to create a application that can select documents from your local pc and compare them for simlarities with other documents. below is a snap shot of the project brief

## Architecture
- <h3>Java</h3
![Java](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/swtor/images/6/6a/Java-logo.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/640?cb=20120527140728.png "java")
Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[15] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.
- <h3>Eclispe JEE</h3>
![JEE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/sites/all/themes/solstice/_themes/solstice_packages/logo.png "Eclipse JEE")
Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming, and is the most widely used Java IDE.[6] It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. Eclipse is written mostly in Java and its primary use is for developing Java applications. Eclispe JEE is used in particular for developing JAVA web Applications.
- <h3>JSP</h3>
![]()
JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology that helps software developers create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, or other document types. Released in 1999 by Sun Microsystems,[1] JSP is similar to PHP and ASP, but it uses the Java programming language.
- <h3>Apache Tomcat</h3>
![AP](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/228391/apache-tomcat.png "Apache")
Apache Tomcat, often referred to as Tomcat Server, is an open-source Java Servlet Container developed by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Tomcat implements several Java EE specifications including Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), Java EL, and WebSocket, and provides a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment in which Java code can run.
Tomcat is developed and maintained by an open community of developers under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation, released under the Apache License 2.0 license, and is open-source software.
- <h3>DB4o</h3>
![DB](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/109792765/db4o_logo_RGB_Cut.png "DB4o")
db4o (database for objects) was an embeddable open source object database for Java and .NET developers. It was developed, commercially licensed and supported by Actian. db4o represents an object-oriented database model. One of its main goals is to provide an easy and native interface to persistence for object oriented programming languages. Development with db4o database does not require a separate data model creation, the applicationâ€™s class model defines the structure of the data. db4o attempts to avoid the object/relational impedance mismatch by eliminating the relational layer from a software project. db4o is written in Java and .NET and provides the respective APIs. It can run on any operating system that supports Java or .NET. It is offered under licenses including GPL, the db4o Opensource Compatibility License (dOCL), and a commercial license for use in proprietary software.

## How To Run
1. Download the zip file of the repository.
2. unzip the zip folder.
3. Open eclispe and create a new dynamic web app with the name "AOOPProject2018"
4. open the containing folder that you unzipped and drag across the need resources.
5. these resources are the everything in the SRC folder, the txt files folder, the contents of the web content folder.
